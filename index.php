Since 2003, organizers of UCSB's Primavera Festival have worked to
highlight the work of UCSB faculty, staff, and students in the
performing, visual, and media arts.  Anchored by the Ensemble for
Contemporary Music (ECM), directed by Jeremy Haladyna, and CREATE
(Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology), this year's
festival also features an international roster of guest artists:
Elizabeth Hoffman (NYU), Marcus Schmickler (visiting professor at
CalArts), Lucia Mense of Cologne, Germany, the Now Hear Ensemble, and
Ignition Duo.

<p><i>Des Gestes Touchants</i></p>

<p>
Alexis Crawshaw, vibrotactile music.
Guest artist Maud Watel-Kazak, mime and dance.
Featuring the CREATE ensemble, directed by Matt Wright
</p>

<p>"Touching gestures" is an interdisciplinary, collaborative improvisational performance with the computer music of the CREATE Ensemble led by Matthew Wright, comic mime and dance performance by guest artist/actress Maud Watel-Kazak, and a vibrotactile music component by Alexis Story Crawshaw. This work will explore different rapports of "mapping" and "feedback" between the domains of theater and electroacoustic music. It will also investigate the musicality of touch using vibrotactile actuators, thereby inviting synaesthestic associations through gesture across three modalities: sonic, visual, and tactile.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 24, 6:00 – 7:00 PM. Music Bowl. Free</p>
