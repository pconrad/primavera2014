Since 2003, organizers of UCSB's <b>Primavera Festival</b> have striven to
highlight the work of UCSB faculty, staff, and students in the
performing, visual, and media arts.  Anchored by the Ensemble for
Contemporary Music (ECM), directed by Jeremy Haladyna, and electroacoustic music from the 
Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE), this year's
festival also features an international roster of guest artists:
Elizabeth Hoffman (NYU), Marcus Schmickler (visiting professor at
CalArts), Lucia Mense (Cologne, Germany), Maud Watel Kazak (Paris), 
the <a href="artists#NowHear">Now Hear Ensemble</a>, 
and <a href="artists#Ignition">Ignition Duo</a>.

<p><i>Des Gestes Touchants</i></p>

<p>
Alexis Crawshaw, vibrotactile music.
Guest artist Maud Watel-Kazak, mime and dance.
Featuring the CREATE ensemble, directed by Matt Wright
</p>

<p>"Touching gestures" is an interdisciplinary, collaborative improvisational performance with the computer music of the CREATE Ensemble led by Matthew Wright, comic mime and dance performance by guest artist/actress Maud Watel-Kazak, and a vibrotactile music component by Alexis Story Crawshaw. This work will explore different rapports of "mapping" and "feedback" between the domains of theater and electroacoustic music. It will also investigate the musicality of touch using vibrotactile actuators, thereby inviting synaesthestic associations through gesture across three modalities: sonic, visual, and tactile.</p>

<p>Music Bowl. Free</p>

<p><i>Made in California&mdash;Now Hear Ensemble</i></p>


<p>The Made in California project is an exciting collaborative concert series with 11 composers throughout the state. Now Hear Ensemble believes that collaboration is a tremendously useful mode of creation for new music. The landscape of Californian music is rich and diverse, and as a part of this artistic realm, NHE seeks to create an accessible, uniform medium for the interchange of ideas between composers, performers and audiences. Made in California will be presented in San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San Francisco.</p>

<p>Music by Eoin Callery, Carolyn Chen, Todd Lerew, Mateo Lugo, Daniel Miller, Jon Myers, Iv&aacute;n Naranjo, Nick Norton, Dan VanHassel, David Werfelmann and Kevin Zhang&mdash;composers with ties to CalArts, Mills College, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara and USC.
Members of Now Hear Ensemble are Federico Llach, Double bass/Artistic Director; Jonathan Morgan, viola; Anthony Garcia, percussion; Joel Hunt, saxophone; Amanda Kritzberg, clarinet.</p>

<p><i>La perception transamplith&eacute;&acirc;trale.<br />
      Alexis Crawshaw, Maud Watel-Kazak, Marcos Novak</i></p>



<p>This transdisciplinary installation/performance explores the ideas of
fractured perception, multiphrenia (after psychologist Kenneth
J.Gergen, that one personality becomes fragmented into many as a
symptom of the demands of modern society and the sometimes conflicting
roles that we must play within it), apophenia (the tendency of the
mind to construct meaning or agency in otherwise meaningless data),
and how our experience of the world is shaped by context and
environment. A collaboration between Alexis Crawshaw, guest artist
Maud Watel-Kazak, and Marcos Novak, this work is an investigation,
through diverse modalities, into the contiguous relationship between
performance/artistic gesture (by the artists), perceptual gesture (by
the audience member), and contextual gesture (by the manipulation of
space in the venue of performance).</p>

<p>Present in the work is the use of 3D-generated masks expressing
multiphrenia and inviting multiple interpretations on the part of its
perceiver. It will feature original poetry in "Franglish" that
develops author Raymond Roussel's method of proc&eacute;d&eacute; and
psychologist Diana Deutsch's study of "phantom words". Virtual art
projections will develop how one can approach and thus perceive the
same physical space in multiple ways, depending on the point of focus
and the context, also as a function of accumulated memory. There will
equally be a study of the psychosomatic influences of the installation
on audience members through vibrotactile infrasounds, using feedback
from a heart-rate sensor.</p>

<p>transLAB, 2615 Elings Hall. Free.</p>

<p><i>Loxodroming III, with Ignition Duo</i></p>



<p>Ignition Duo, the Bay Area guitar duo (Ramon Fermin and David
Gonzales), will return to Santa Barbara to perform an entire program
of works from UCSB composers for the PRIMAVERA Festival. Close to ten
works from UCSB students and alumni were specially written for the duo
and will be premiered in the festival. Ignition Duo has gained a
significant experience with programs and repertory specially composed
for them as their commitment to new music is very exciting and
inspiring. Their project ranges from performance with acoustic
classical guitars to electric guitars and also includes interaction
with fixed media and live electronics. The concert will feature works
from Barel, Cho, Crawshaw, Evans, Garcia, Gordon, Jette, Norton,
Rolle, Taylor and Yoon.</p>
