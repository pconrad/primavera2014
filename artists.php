	        <p>Clarence Barlow is the Corwin Professor of Composition and he holds the Corwin Chair. From its inception, the Corwin Chair has been an important post for promoting the creation and performance of contemporary music, for making regional, national, and international connections with other composition programs, for bringing noted composers to UCSB as guests to broaden students' horizons, and for attracting students to UCSB. Barlow's career achievements fulfill the Corwin's vision of fostering a link between continuing excellence in traditional approaches to composition while also recognizing the emerging role of music in the media arts and technology. Barlow's past and current teaching posts include twelve years as Professor of Composition and Computer Music at the renowned biennial Summer Courses of the International Music Institute at Darmstadt (1982-1994); over twenty years as Lecturer in Computer Music at Cologne Music University (1984-2005); four years as Artistic Director of the Institute of Sonology at The Hague's Royal Conservatoire (1990-1994); and twelve years as Professor of Composition and Sonology at the Royal Conservatoire (1994-2006). Other posts include Visiting Professor of Composition and Acoustic Art at the Folkwang University in Essen, Germany (1990-1991), and Visiting Professor of Composition at the ESMAE School of Music and Dramatic Arts in Porto, Portugal (2005-2006).

Barlow, who studied composition under Bernd Alois Zimmermann (1968-1970) and Karlheinz Stockhausen (1971-1973), is a universally acknowledged pioneer and celebrated composer in the field of electroacoustic and computer music. He has made groundbreaking advancements in interdisciplinary composition that unite mathematics, computer science, visual arts, and literature. While he has been a driving force in interdisciplinary and technological advances, his music is nevertheless firmly grounded in tradition and thus incorporates much inherited from the past.

	        <p>Alexis Story Crawshaw, born in 1986, grew up in San Rafael, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. She started composing at the age of 10 following her very first piano lesson. She received a Bachelors of Art degree in Music Composition from the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara. There, she studied acoustic composition under Jeremy Haladyna and electroacoustic composition under Curtis Roads. After graduating with High Honors, she moved to Paris to continue her studies at the private music school, La Schola Cantorum. There, she developed her technical skills in orchestration, counterpoint, harmony and piano. After two years of study, she started a Masters program at the Université Paris 8, under the direction of Anne Sedes, focusing on research and creation/composition. She graduated with a Mention Très Bien (Highest Honors). Alexis is currently a PhD student in UCSB’s Media Arts and Technology Program
Crawshaw's research mostly concerns infrasounds and intersensorial perception in the context of electroacoustic composition. In particular, Crawshaw is interested in the impacts that infrasounds have on both architectural and corporal structures, their psychosomatic effects, and their intersensorial properties and potential uses involving vibrotactility and vision. Another somewhat separate area of interest and study is the influence of music on gustative and olfactive perception in the context of wine tasting.
Crawshaw has received notable recognition for her electroacoustic works, in particular her composition "like a submarine in a dream", winning 1st place in the 2008 Sherril C. Corwin Awards in the Music Composition, Electroacoustic division. Her Art Music Video projects "peindre" and "stereo dinner time" were among those featured in a 2008 Art Music Video exhibition at the Santa Barbara Museum. In 2011, she composed a choral work "Création Mondiale" for La Chorale de la Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris, directed by Italo Marchini, premiered at their spring concert. Her piece "i'm thinking of an object you can find in the metro" was featured in the 2011 L'Atelier de Composition, run by José-Manuel López López, and was selected among the works to appear in a special concert the following day at the Institut Cervantes.

	        <p>Emma Lou Diemer was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on November 24, 1927. Her father, George Willis Diemer, was an educator (college president); her mother, Myrtle Casebolt Diemer, was a church worker and homemaker. Emma Lou played the piano and composed at a very early age and became organist in her church at age 13. Her great interest in composing music continued through College High School in Warrensburg, MO, and she majored in composition at the Yale Music School (BM, 1949; MM, 1950) and at the Eastman School of Music (Ph.D, 1960). She studied in Brussels, Belgium on a Fulbright Scholarship and spent two summers of composition study at the Berkshire Music Center.
She taught in several colleges and was organist at several churches in the Kansas City area during the 1950s. From 1959-61 she was composer-in-residence in the Arlington, VA schools under the Ford Foundation Young Composers Project, and composed many choral and instrumental works for the schools, a number of which are still in publication. She was consultant for the MENC Contemporary Music Project before joining the faculty of the University of Maryland where she taught composition and theory from 1965-70. In 1971 she moved from the East Coast to teach composition and theory at the University of California, Santa Barbara. At UCSB she was instrumental in founding the electronic/computer music program. In 1991 she became Professor Emeritus at UCSB.</p>
<p>
Through the years she has fulfilled many commissions (orchestral, chamber ensemble, keyboard, choral, vocal) from schools, churches, and professional organizations. Most of her works are published. She has received awards from Yale University (Certificate of Merit), The Eastman School of Music (Edward Benjamin Award), the National Endowment for the Arts (electronic music project), Mu Phi Epsilon (Certificate of Merit), the Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards (for piano concerto), the American Guild of Organists (Composer of the Year), the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers/ASCAP (annually since 1962 for performances and publications), the Santa Barbara Symphony (composer-in-residence, 1990-92), the University of Central Missouri (honorary doctorate), and many others.</p>
<p>She is an active keyboard performer (piano, organ, harpsichord, synthesizer), and in the last few years has given concerts of her own music at Washington National Cathedral, St. Mary's Cathedral and Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Emma Lou Diemer lives in Santa Barbara, California.

	       <p>Joel Feigin (b: New York City, 

1951) is a composer whose music has been heard across the U.S., Europe and Asia, his 

works widely praised for their "very strong impact, as logical in musical design as they 

are charged with emotion and drama." (<i>Opera</i> <i>Magazine</i>) Feigin's many 

honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Senior Fulbright Fellowship at the Moscow State 

Conservatory in Russia (1998-1999) and a Fromm Foundation Commission from the 

Israeli-American pianist, Yael Weiss, for <i>Aviv:</i> <i>Concerto for Piano and Chamber 

Orchestra</i>, premiered under the direction of David Dzubay in September 2010. Previously, 

pianist Margaret Mills had commissioned and premiered <i>Variations on Empty 

Space</i>, which is included on her Cambria Master Recordings CD, <i>Meditations and 

Overtones</i>, along with Feigin's <i>Four Meditations from</i> <i>Dogen</i>. The disk is available 

at <a href="http://cambriamus.com/" target="_blank">http://cambriamus.com/</a>. Feigin's two operatic works, <i>Mysteries of Eleusis </i>

and <i>Twelfth Night</i>, have been presented by the Moscow Conservatory, the Russian-American 

Festival of Operatic Art, Long Leaf Opera, and Theatre Cornell, as well as in 

New York City Opera's VOX 2003 Showcase and the New Works Sampler at the 2006 Opera 

America Conference in Seattle, Washington. A scene from <i>Twelfth Night </i>

can be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc69AkqMFKk">seen on YouTube</a>. Feigin's 

chamber and orchestral music has been performed and commissioned by such groups 

as the Santa Barbara Symphony, Speculum Musicae, Parnassus, and Piano-Spheres. <i>

Transience,  </i><a href="http://www.northsouthmusic.org/Transcience--Music-of-Joel-Feigin">a 2-CD set on North/South Recordings</a>, 

followed a full evening of chamber and vocal works 

performed by Musicians Accord in New York City in 1995; concerts devoted solely 

to Feigin's music have also been given in Armenia and Russia. A student of Zen Buddhism 

and Professor of Composition at the University of California Santa Barbara, Feigin 

studied with Nadia Boulanger at Fontainebleau and with Roger Sessions at The Juilliard 

School. His website can be found at <a href="http://www.joelfeigin.com">www.joelfeigin.com</a>.</p>
