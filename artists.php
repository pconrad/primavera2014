	        <p>Professor Clarence Barlow is the Corwin Endowed Chair of Composition at the University of California-Santa Barbara. From its inception, the Corwin Chair has been an important post for promoting the creation and performance of contemporary music, for making regional, national, and international connections with other composition programs, for bringing noted composers to UCSB as guests to broaden students' horizons, and for attracting students to UCSB. Barlow's career achievements fulfill the Corwin's vision of fostering a link between continuing excellence in traditional approaches to composition while also recognizing the emerging role of music in the media arts and technology. Barlow's past and current teaching posts include twelve years as Professor of Composition and Computer Music at the renowned biennial Summer Courses of the International Music Institute at Darmstadt (1982-1994); over twenty years as Lecturer in Computer Music at the Cologne Musikhochschule (1984-2005); four years as Artistic Director of the Institute of Sonology at The Hague 's Royal Conservatory (1990-1994); and twelve years as Professor of Composition and Sonology at the Royal Conservatory (1994-2006). Other posts include Visiting Professor of Composition and Acoustic Art at the Folkwang University in Essen, Germany (1990-1991), and Visiting Professor of Composition at the ESMAE School of Music and Dramatic Arts in Porto, Portugal (2005-2006). Barlow, who studied composition under Bernd Alois Zimmermann (1968-1970) and Karlheinz Stockhausen (1971-1973), is a universally acknowledged pioneer and celebrated composer in the field of electroacoustic and computer music. He has made groundbreaking advancements in interdisciplinary composition that unite mathematics, computer science, visual arts, and literature. While he has been a driving force in interdisciplinary and technological advances, his music is nevertheless firmly grounded in tradition and thus incorporates much inherited from the past. His works, primarily for traditional instruments, feature a vocabulary that ranges from pretonal to tonal, nontonal, or microtonal idioms, and, further, may incorporate elements derived from non-western cultures.</p>

	       <p>Joel Feigin (b: New York City, 

1951) is a composer whose music has been heard across the U.S., Europe and Asia, his 

works widely praised for their "very strong impact, as logical in musical design as they 

are charged with emotion and drama." (<i>Opera</i> <i>Magazine</i>) Feigin's many 

honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Senior Fulbright Fellowship at the Moscow State 

Conservatory in Russia (1998-1999) and a Fromm Foundation Commission from the 

Israeli-American pianist, Yael Weiss, for <i>Aviv:</i> <i>Concerto for Piano and Chamber 

Orchestra</i>, premiered under the direction of David Dzubay in September 2010. Previously, 

pianist Margaret Mills had commissioned and premiered <i>Variations on Empty 

Space</i>, which is included on her Cambria Master Recordings CD, <i>Meditations and 

Overtones</i>, along with Feigin's <i>Four Meditations from</i> <i>Dogen</i>. The disk is available 

at <a href="http://cambriamus.com/" target="_blank">http://cambriamus.com/</a>. Feigin's two operatic works, <i>Mysteries of Eleusis </i>

and <i>Twelfth Night</i>, have been presented by the Moscow Conservatory, the Russian-American 

Festival of Operatic Art, Long Leaf Opera, and Theatre Cornell, as well as in 

New York City Opera's VOX 2003 Showcase and the New Works Sampler at the 2006 Opera 

America Conference in Seattle, Washington. A scene from <i>Twelfth Night </i>

can be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc69AkqMFKk">seen on YouTube</a>. Feigin's 

chamber and orchestral music has been performed and commissioned by such groups 

as the Santa Barbara Symphony, Speculum Musicae, Parnassus, and Piano-Spheres. <i>

Transience,  </i><a href="http://www.northsouthmusic.org/Transcience--Music-of-Joel-Feigin">a 2-CD set on North/South Recordings</a>, 

followed a full evening of chamber and vocal works 

performed by Musicians Accord in New York City in 1995; concerts devoted solely 

to Feigin's music have also been given in Armenia and Russia. A student of Zen Buddhism 

and Professor of Composition at the University of California Santa Barbara, Feigin 

studied with Nadia Boulanger at Fontainebleau and with Roger Sessions at The Juilliard 

School. His website can be found at <a href="http://www.joelfeigin.com">www.joelfeigin.com</a>.</p>
