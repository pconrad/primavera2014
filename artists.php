	        <p>Clarence Barlow is the Corwin Professor of Composition and he holds the Corwin Chair. From its inception, the Corwin Chair has been an important post for promoting the creation and performance of contemporary music, for making regional, national, and international connections with other composition programs, for bringing noted composers to UCSB as guests to broaden students' horizons, and for attracting students to UCSB. Barlow's career achievements fulfill the Corwin's vision of fostering a link between continuing excellence in traditional approaches to composition while also recognizing the emerging role of music in the media arts and technology. Barlow's past and current teaching posts include twelve years as Professor of Composition and Computer Music at the renowned biennial Summer Courses of the International Music Institute at Darmstadt (1982-1994); over twenty years as Lecturer in Computer Music at Cologne Music University (1984-2005); four years as Artistic Director of the Institute of Sonology at The Hague's Royal Conservatoire (1990-1994); and twelve years as Professor of Composition and Sonology at the Royal Conservatoire (1994-2006). Other posts include Visiting Professor of Composition and Acoustic Art at the Folkwang University in Essen, Germany (1990-1991), and Visiting Professor of Composition at the ESMAE School of Music and Dramatic Arts in Porto, Portugal (2005-2006).

Barlow, who studied composition under Bernd Alois Zimmermann (1968-1970) and Karlheinz Stockhausen (1971-1973), is a universally acknowledged pioneer and celebrated composer in the field of electroacoustic and computer music. He has made groundbreaking advancements in interdisciplinary composition that unite mathematics, computer science, visual arts, and literature. While he has been a driving force in interdisciplinary and technological advances, his music is nevertheless firmly grounded in tradition and thus incorporates much inherited from the past.

	        <p>Alexis Story Crawshaw, born in 1986, grew up in San Rafael, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. She started composing at the age of 10 following her very first piano lesson. She received a Bachelors of Art degree in Music Composition from the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara. There, she studied acoustic composition under Jeremy Haladyna and electroacoustic composition under Curtis Roads. After graduating with High Honors, she moved to Paris to continue her studies at the private music school, La Schola Cantorum. There, she developed her technical skills in orchestration, counterpoint, harmony and piano. After two years of study, she started a Masters program at the Universit&eacute; Paris 8, under the direction of Anne Sedes, focusing on research and creation/composition. She graduated with a Mention Tr&egrave;s Bien (Highest Honors). Alexis is currently a PhD student in UCSB's Media Arts and Technology Program.</p>
<p>Crawshaw's research mostly concerns infrasounds and intersensorial perception in the context of electroacoustic composition. In particular, Crawshaw is interested in the impacts that infrasounds have on both architectural and corporal structures, their psychosomatic effects, and their intersensorial properties and potential uses involving vibrotactility and vision. Another somewhat separate area of interest and study is the influence of music on gustative and olfactive perception in the context of wine tasting.</p>
<p>Crawshaw has received notable recognition for her electroacoustic works, in particular her composition "like a submarine in a dream", winning 1st place in the 2008 Sherril C. Corwin Awards in the Music Composition, Electroacoustic division. Her Art Music Video projects "peindre" and "stereo dinner time" were among those featured in a 2008 Art Music Video exhibition at the Santa Barbara Museum. In 2011, she composed a choral work "Cr&eacute;ation Mondiale" for La Chorale de la Cit&eacute; Internationale Universitaire de Paris, directed by Italo Marchini, premiered at their spring concert. Her piece "i'm thinking of an object you can find in the metro" was featured in the 2011 L'Atelier de Composition, run by Jos&eacute;-Manuel L&oacute;pez L&oacute;pez, and was selected among the works to appear in a special concert the following day at the Institut Cervantes.

	        <p>Emma Lou Diemer was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on November 24, 1927. Her father, George Willis Diemer, was an educator (college president); her mother, Myrtle Casebolt Diemer, was a church worker and homemaker. Emma Lou played the piano and composed at a very early age and became organist in her church at age 13. Her great interest in composing music continued through College High School in Warrensburg, MO, and she majored in composition at the Yale Music School (BM, 1949; MM, 1950) and at the Eastman School of Music (Ph.D, 1960). She studied in Brussels, Belgium on a Fulbright Scholarship and spent two summers of composition study at the Berkshire Music Center.
She taught in several colleges and was organist at several churches in the Kansas City area during the 1950s. From 1959-61 she was composer-in-residence in the Arlington, VA schools under the Ford Foundation Young Composers Project, and composed many choral and instrumental works for the schools, a number of which are still in publication. She was consultant for the MENC Contemporary Music Project before joining the faculty of the University of Maryland where she taught composition and theory from 1965-70. In 1971 she moved from the East Coast to teach composition and theory at the University of California, Santa Barbara. At UCSB she was instrumental in founding the electronic/computer music program. In 1991 she became Professor Emeritus at UCSB.</p>
<p>
Through the years she has fulfilled many commissions (orchestral, chamber ensemble, keyboard, choral, vocal) from schools, churches, and professional organizations. Most of her works are published. She has received awards from Yale University (Certificate of Merit), The Eastman School of Music (Edward Benjamin Award), the National Endowment for the Arts (electronic music project), Mu Phi Epsilon (Certificate of Merit), the Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards (for piano concerto), the American Guild of Organists (Composer of the Year), the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers/ASCAP (annually since 1962 for performances and publications), the Santa Barbara Symphony (composer-in-residence, 1990-92), the University of Central Missouri (honorary doctorate), and many others.</p>
<p>She is an active keyboard performer (piano, organ, harpsichord, synthesizer), and in the last few years has given concerts of her own music at Washington National Cathedral, St. Mary's Cathedral and Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and elsewhere.</p>

	        <p>Peter Racine Fricker (1920-1990) joined the faculty at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1964 as a visiting professor, and became a regular faculty member in 1970. In 1979, he was appointed Faculty Research Lecturer, and remained an active professor at the University until his death in 1990.</p>

<p>In his will, he arranged for his estate to be used to fund an endowment for the graduate program in Composition at UCSB. The <i>Peter Racine Fricker Fellowship for Studies in Composition</i> provides fellowships for graduate students as well as postdoctoral students in the Composition Program of the Music Department at the University of California at Santa Barbara. 
</p>
<p>Fricker's substantial output of symphonies, concertos and string quartets formed an important contribution to the growth of a more progressive, European outlook among British composers in the immediate postwar years.  A contrapuntalist, he was influenced by the examples of Bartok and Hindemtih, though using serial methods as well. His vocal and choral works were few in number, though the oratorio <i>The Vision of Judgement</i> remains highly regarded.

	        <p>Professor Marcos Novak, director of transLAB, is a pioneer in the field of virtual architecture. In the mid 90s, his contribution to Inteational architectural discourse was further expanded by the coining and definition of the term "Transarchitectures" His approach: "we conceive algorithmically (morphogenesis); we model numerically (rapid prototyping); we build robotically (new tectonics); we inhabit interactively (intelligent space); we telecommunicate instantly (pantopicon); we are informed immersively (liquid architectures); we socialise nonlocally (nonlocal public domain); we evert virtuality (transarchitectures)". He has also posited a new "Soft Babylon," a theoretical stance which posits that our digitized architectural palette is causing us to create a wired Situationist city, while we struggle with some of the massive paradigm shifts that our era will and must face. Whilst articulating highly fluent theory, he has practiced, producing beautiful ethereal architectures that flux and shimmer as his algorithms run their designed logics. He received the Masters of Architecture at Ohio State university in 1983. Since that time he has taught at Ohio State, University of Texas Austin, the Architecture program at UCLA, the Digital Media program at UCLA, and the Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. He has published, lectured and exhibited his work internationally.

	        <p>Curtis Roads teaches and pursues research in the interdisciplinary territory spanning music and technology. He was Editor and Associate Editor of <i>Computer Music Journal</i> (The MIT Press) from 1978 to 2000, and cofounded the International Computer Music Association in 1979. A researcher in computer music at MIT (1980-1986), he also worked in the computer industry for a decade. He taught electronic music composition at Harvard University, and sound synthesis techniques at the University of Naples. He was appointed Director of Pedagogy at Les Ateliers UPIC (later CCMIX) and Lecturer in the Music Department of the Universit&eacute; Paris 8.</p>

<p>Among his books are the anthologies <i>Foundations of Computer Music</i> (1985, The MIT Press) and <i>The Music Machine</i> (1989, The MIT Press). His textbook <i>The Computer Music Tutorial</i> (1996, The MIT Press) is widely adopted as a standard classroom text and has been published in French (1999, second edition 2007), Japanese (2001), and Chinese (forthcoming) editions. He edited the anthology <i>Musical Signal Processing</i> in 1997. His book, <i>Microsound</i> (2002, The MIT Press) presents the techniques and aesthetics of composition with sound particles. A pioneer in the development of granular synthesis (1974), he also developed (with Alberto de Campo) a sound particle synthesis program PulsarGenerator (2001), distributed by the Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE) at UCSB. His collection of electronic music compositions POINT LINE CLOUD won the Award of Distinction at the 2002 Ars Electronica in Linz and was released as a CD + DVD on the Asphodel label in 2005. His new book is <i>Composing Electronic Music: A New Aesthetic</i> (forthcoming) published by Oxford University Press. A new revised edition of <i>The Computer Music Tutorial</i> by The MIT Press will follow.</p><p> He is keenly interested in the integration of electronic music with visual and spatial media. Since 2004, he has been researching a new method of sound analysis that is the analytical counterpart of granular synthesis called dictionary-based pursuit, which has been sponsored by the National Science Foundation. A new collection of electronic music is in the works.

	        <p>Marcus Schmickler studied electronic music and composition in Cologne, Germany. As a composer, along with his many works of electronic music, he worked with the ensemble recherche, musikFabrik, Ensemble zeitkratzer, the Schlagquatet K&ouml;ln as well as with orchestras and choirs. He is also an active improviser, working with other improvising instrumentalists, such as Thomas Lehn, and John Tilbury, mainly using computer. His interest in more conventional forms of music is reflected in his activity with the Pluramon project, in which he also colaborated with Julee Cruise.  His discography so far consists of over 50 titles and he has been performing on the world's stages and at international festivals for years. He also appeared as a composer in the field of theatre, radiophonic art and film as well as writing about computer music and acoustics. Schmickler has won numerous prizes and honours and is closely associated with the labels a-Musik, editionsMego and the now defunct Mille Plateaux. He runs his own studio Piethopraxis in Cologne.

	        <p>Matt Wright, director of the CREATE ensemble, received his PhD, Stanford/CCRMA,  B.A. UC Berkeley/CNMAT,  Post-Doc UVic/MISTIC.  Dr. Wright's dissertation "The Shape of an Instant: Measuring and Modeling Perceptual Attack Time with Probability Density Functions" concerned models of musical rhythm, including onsets, repetition, pulsation, meter, and phrasing, with particular emphasis on the question of when exactly we perceive musical events to occur. His interests are both theoretical and practical, aimed towards computer simulation of perceptual aspects of listening to musical rhythm for the construction of "automatic listeners". He worked for 15 years as the Musical Systems Designer at UC Berkeley's Center for New Music and Audio Technology (CNMAT), conducting research in topics including intimate musical control of computers, sound analysis and resynthesis, and rhythm; at CNMAT he helped to develop and propagate the now well established and much appreciated SDIF (Sound Description Interchange Format) and OSC (Open Sound Control) standards. His post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Victoria was devoted to the emerging field of computational ethnomusicology, and he is now the Research Director at UC Santa Barbara's Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE). He is also an accomplished musician, focusing for the last many years on musics of non-Western cultures, with a special interest in Afro-Brazilian percussion and on the musics of India, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and North Africa.</p>
